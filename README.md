Week-2 HW VBA

Purpose of homework 
HW2 using VBA script through excel gave an insight on how to define variables, set headings and run the script through all the rows. Also, VBA is a great start before getting into python and pandas because it prepares on how to run a code and define what the goal is through scripting each step that will be implemented in the sheet.  
how you did it 
I first defined the variables, columns, and rows where my data output will be recorded, then I scripted the output. It was a little challenging when it comes to scripting certain data. I used Xpert assistance to assist me with my data. 
conclusion and thoughts 
I thought this exercise is very helpful to start coding especially before python and pandas. The data conclusion showed who has the greatest increase,greatest decrease and total volume. I'm excited to see what's next.
